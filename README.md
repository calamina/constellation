# TODO
## polish
- try accent color instead of full background color :<
- small logo over the top left corner or top center with light animation
- small logo over specs with light animation, like a centered triangle with border (and bg going over the main border) with 180Â° rotation from time to time
- maybe the same for topology, graphs and paths
- add satellites / rings names/count ?
- add indicator for core interaction + animation (globally like pulse + very small rotation for the whole ui ?)
- slow animations on core click ?
- add differences for radars and paths for each planet
- next / previous animation polish/++
- inert everywhere ...

## new features
- change whole mood depending on panet (no borders / diff sizes / rearrange ?)
- one more planet with orbs like the ps2 logo
- animation on click (open?), rotation and controls
- separate elements on click ?
- try using orbitcontrols again (only rotation)

## clean code 
- try replacing absolute positioning wouin
- clean topology CSS / HTML
- clean css
- clean ts
